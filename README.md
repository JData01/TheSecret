# Cryptographic Commitment

This repository serves as a **public cryptographic commitment** for a long-running treasure hunt whose solutions unfold over time, inspired by *The Secret* by Byron Preiss.

It contains SHA-256 hashes of documents describing complete solutions for individual locations. These hashes were generated prior to any public disclosure of those solutions.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to establish:

- A verifiable, time-stamped record of solution documents
- A neutral method for future confirmation without early disclosure
- A good-faith commitment to accuracy, consistency, and restraint

No locations, coordinates, maps, or actionable instructions are published here.

## Verification

When a solution becomes publicly confirmed:

1. The corresponding document may be released without modification
2. Its SHA-256 hash can be independently computed
3. The result can be compared against the value recorded in this repository

A match confirms the document existed in this exact form prior to release.

## Intent and Scope

- This repository does not claim authority, ownership, or exclusivity
- It does not direct, influence, or interfere with active searches
- It exists solely to preserve integrity over long timescales

The design assumption is that verification may occur years—or decades—after initial publication.

## Status

This repository is intentionally minimal.

Silence is part of the commitment.

## Acknowledgment

This work was made possible by the extensive research, discussion, and preservation of knowledge contributed over many years by the *The Secret* community. Studying the history of the people, places, and artifacts involved has provided invaluable insight and a deeper appreciation for the context surrounding these puzzles. This effort would not have been possible without the contributions of previous and current researchers.

This repository is shared with respect for that ongoing effort.
